This application is designed by using cordova platform.
Information about railway track will be fetched to application by arduino.


INTRODUCTION-
 TODAY, WE ALL KNOW THAT INDIAN RAILWAYS IS IN DETRIMENTAL SITUATION DUE TO VARIOUS RAILWAY ACCIDENTS. MOST OF THE ACCIDENTS HAPPEN DUE TO RAILWAY FRACTURES.
 ACCORDING TO A SURVEY ,  ABOUT 60% OF ACCIDENTS TAKES PLACE DUE TO RAILWAY TRACK FRACTURES. OUR IDEA IS SIMPLY ABOUT HOW WE CAN DETECT THE RAILWAY FRACTURES AND PROVIDE A SECURITY MAJOR.
PROPOSED IDEA â€“
WE ARE MAKING A HARDWARE DEVICE WHICH IS ALWAYS CONNECTED TO SOFTWARE . HARDWARE IS SIMPLY CONSISTS OF A SENSOR WHICH IDENTIFIES ALL THE CRACKS AND FRACTURES IN THE TRACK . THE SENSOR CAN TRACK ALL THE CRACKS IN A CONSOLIDATED FORM.
THERE ARE 13000 TRAINS IN INDIA .  ALL ARE EMPLOYED TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN INDIA.
THIS HARDWARE CAN DETECT CRACKS OVER A SPECIFIC RANGE OF TRACK DURING A RUNNING TRAIN.
T HIS HARDWARE WILL BE EMPLOYED TO EVERY TRAIN WHICH IS CONNECTED TO A SOFTWARE AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UPDATED TIME TO TIME ABOUT THE CRACKS ON RAILWAY LINES.ALL THE HARDWARE IN VARIOUS TRAINS ARE CONNECTED THROUGH INTERNET OF THINGS .
IF A FRACTURE IS DETECTED THEN HARDWARE WILL UPADTE THE SOFTWARE AND A SPECIAL MESSAGE WOULD BE SEND TO RAILWAY CONTROL HEAD OFFICE VIA (GSM MODEM) . AFTER THE DETECTION OF FRACTURES IN THE TRACK THE TRAIN WOULD BE STOPPED ITSELF BY THE USE OF HYDRAULIC BRAKES WHICH IS  PROVIDED IN THE TRAINS NOWDAYS.
THE IDEA WILL PROVIDE A SPECIFIC NETWORK OVER THE TRAINS AND A SPECIAL SAFETY NETWORK WOULD BE CREATED THROUGH WHICH THE ACCIDENTS OF TRAINS WOULD REDUCE OR MAY STOP.
IT WILL ALSO REDUCE THE PRESSURE FROM THE STAFF OFFICIALS  AS THE IDEA IS DESIGNED TO DO THINGS AUTOMATICALLY AND IT WILL UPDATE  ALL THE INFORMATION REGARDING A SPECIFIC TRACK TO THE HEAD OFFICE.    
WORKING OF SYSTEM-
THIS NETWORK OF (IOT) WILL PROVIDE A SAFETY MAJOR TO THE WHOLE RAILWAY NETWORK. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE A RESEMBLING STRUCTURE OF ELECTRONIC CIRCUITING OF TRACKS WHICH IS DYNAMIC IN NATURE BECAUSE THE HARDWARE IS EMPLOYED IN THE TRAINS .

ADVANTAGES OF IDEA-
1.	IT WILL PROVIDE A SAFETY MAJOR TO THE RAILWAY NETWORKS.
2.	OUR IDEA IS VERY COST EFFICIENT AND FEASIBLE TO IMPLEMENT.
3.	LESS MAINTENANCE COST FOR THE (IOT) BASED SYSTEM.
4.	 IT WILL REDUCE OR MAY STOP THE RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.
5.	GOVERNMENT  WOULD ACCESS TO THE IDEA IN A FEASIBLE IMPLEMENTATION.
6.	TRAIN WOULD BE STOPPED ITSELF BY THE USE OF HYDRAULIC BRAKES WHICH IS  PROVIDED IN  TRAINS NOWDAYS.
